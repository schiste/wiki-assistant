description: Use when starting work in an unfamiliar repository, when the task asks for repo overview, setup, architecture, entrypoints, test commands, or where to begin. Skip for narrow file-scoped edits once the relevant paths are already known.

# Repo Onboarding: wiki-assistant

## When to Use

- Load this skill first when the repository is unfamiliar or the request is broad.
- Recommended when: first task in repo, repo overview, setup or run instructions, architecture or entrypoints, where should I start, broad debugging or feature-localization request.
- Skip when: known file-scoped edit, follow-up inside already identified area, task already localized to concrete files.
- Use `.codex/skills/aethyme/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/aethyme/SKILL.md` for Aethyme's short operating contract after orientation; load its `references/` files only when needed.

## Repo Identity

- Kind: `repository`
- Languages: `unknown`
- Package manager: `unknown`

## Start Here


## Repo Map

- `.github` (automation; automation and CI configuration; high confidence)
- `docs` (docs; documentation area; high confidence)

## Aethyme Recipes

- `aethyme explore --repo "$PWD" --request "<task>" --format answer-json`
  Purpose: Broad repository orientation for a user request
- `aethyme repo inspect "$PWD" --mode brief --json-output`
  Purpose: Quick deterministic repo summary
- `aethyme graph callers "$PWD" "<symbol-or-file>" --json-output`
  Purpose: Trace likely impact before editing

## Freshness

- Source digest: `bcc6fcb25ddaceaec4e18f3bdf737ce3fe243b4232ff31a50d03953fff0a0c8c`
- Tracked source files: `19`
- Overrides applied: `False`
- Sections generated: `repo, commands, areas, entrypoints, caution_zones, navigation_recipes, summon, freshness`
